# Cyber Attack Analysis using Python

## Overview
This project analyzes cybersecurity attack data to identify common attack
types, targeted network protocols, and anomaly patterns using Python and
data analytics techniques.

## Objectives
- Load and explore cybersecurity attack data
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize attack trends and patterns
- Derive meaningful cybersecurity insights

## Dataset
- File: updated_cybersecurity_attacks.csv
- Description: Contains network traffic data including attack types,
  protocols, malware indicators, and anomaly scores.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- DDoS and Malware attacks are the most common
- HTTP and DNS are the most targeted protocols
- High anomaly scores strongly correlate with cyber attacks

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `Cyber_Attack_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis
